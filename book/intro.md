## Introduction

Tutorial series teaching you how to work with NetCDF files. This course requires you to have no prior knowledge of NetCDF files or any coding experience. You will be learn what a NetCDF file is, why they are useful, and be introduced to a range of different free and open tools and softwares that you can use to work with NetCDF files.

You may be here because you are interested in publishing FAIR data. Did you know that a NetCDF file is not necessarily FAIR unless it adheres to certain conventions? You will learn about the Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions (https://cfconventions.org/) and the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD - https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3), and how to make sure your files are compliant with them.
