# Introduction to CF-NetCDF

Tutorial series teaching you how to work with CF-NetCDF files.

This is a work-in-progress, but I hope to include information on
* What is a NetCDF file?
* The Climate & Forecast Conventions
* The Attribute Convention for Data Discovery
* Different ways to access data from a NetCDF file (Panoply, OPeNDAP, Python, R, other tools)
* How to create a CF-NetCDF file (Python, R, Rosetta, MeteoIO, other tools)
